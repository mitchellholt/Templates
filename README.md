# Templates
Templates is a simple template manager. To make a new file from a template, simply
- Add any templates to ~/Desktop/Templates
- Navigate to the directoy where you want to make the new file
- Type `template [filename]`
- Select the template you want to use in fzf

# Prerequisites #
You must have the following, each of which can be installed from their github pages
- tmux
- fzf

# Installation #
Clone the repository and change into the directory created by git. Run `chmod +x ./template.sh`.
Finally, add the location of the script to the path.

For Windows users I hope you know how to make this an executable.
